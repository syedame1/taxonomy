This guide provides a clear framework for distinguishing between use cases best suited for:

* Agentic AI systems – powered by LLMs that operate with autonomy, tool access, contextual memory, and adaptive decision-making.

* Traditional automation – deterministic, rule-based workflows designed for fixed logic and minimal decision variability.

It includes scoring rubrics for:

* Autonomy Level

* Decision Complexity

* (Optional) Integration Feasibility

This guide is designed to support model fine-tuning, use-case classification, and human evaluation workflows.

## What is an Agent?

An agent is a system that independently executes a workflow on behalf of a user, making real-time decisions using:

* A reasoning model (typically an LLM)

* One or more external tools or APIs

* A structured set of instructions or policies

* Memory or contextual awareness across turns or decisions

## What is Traditional Automation?

Traditional automation refers to software systems that follow a fixed set of deterministic instructions or rule based logic:

* No reasoning or inference

* No ability to adapt in real time

* Executes the same path if input conditions are the same

* Cannot learn from feedback or context

## What is a workflow ?

A workflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user's goal, whether that's resolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change, or generating a report.

Applications that integrate LLMs but don't use them to control workflow execution-think simple chatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers-are not agents.

More concretely, an agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and consistently on behalf of a user:

* 01 It leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions. It recognizes when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case of failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.

* 02 It has access to various tools to interact with external systems-both to gather context and to take actions-and dynamically selects the appropriate tools depending on the workflow's current state, always operating within clearly defined guardrails.

## When should you build an agent?

Building agents requires rethinking how your systems make decisions and handle complexity. Unlike conventional automation, agents are uniquely suited to workflows where traditional deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short.

Consider the example of payment fraud analysis. A traditional rules engine works like a checklist, flagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a seasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious activity even when clear-cut rules aren't violated. This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what enables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively.

As you evaluate where agents can add value, prioritize workflows that have previously resisted automation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:

01

Complex

decision-making:

02

Difficult-to-maintain

rules:

03

Heavy reliance on

unstructured data:

Workflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or

context-sensitive decisions, for example refund approval

in customer service workflows.

Systems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and

intricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone,

for example performing vendor security reviews.

Scenarios that involve interpreting natural language,

extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with

users conversationally, for example processing a home

A practical guide to building agents

Before committing to building an agent, validate that your use case can meet these criteria clearly. Otherwise, a deterministic solution may suffice.

## When to Use Agentic AI vs Automation

| Criterion |Agentic AI |Traditional Automation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input Ambiguity |High (unstructured, natural language) |Low (structured, deterministic) |
| Decision Flow |Adaptive, multi-branch |Linear, pre-defined |
| Tool Use |Selects from multiple tools contextually |Fixed tools triggered by events |
| Memory / Context Tracking |Needed (multi-turn, persistent context) |Stateless |
| Fallback or Retry Logic |Required |Rare or hardcoded |
| Examples |Voice assistant, refund approvals |Invoice PDF generation, ETL scheduling |

Tip: Use traditional automation for predictable, single-path workflows. Adopt agents for unstructured problems, exceptions, or context-sensitive behaviour.

## A Simple IF–THEN Workflow Is Not Enough When...

* Decisions must change based on user intent, data confidence, or ambiguity

* Inputs are unstructured or incomplete (e.g., chat requests, voice commands)

* You require fallback logic, retries, escalation, or tool chaining

* A model needs to assess how to solve a problem, not just what to do

## Scoring Rubrics

## Autonomy Level (1–10)

## Score

## Criteria

* 1 Fully rule-based logic, no adaptation

* 3 Basic conditional logic or branching

* 5 Tool use but requires direction for every step

* 7 Can plan steps, use tools, and respond to uncertainty

* 10 Full autonomy: end-to-end reasoning, tool chaining, retries

## Decision Complexity (1–10)

Criteria

* 1 Linear path, no ambiguity

* 3 Basic branching or decision rules

* 5 Some unstructured inputs or fallback handling

* 7 Multi-step reasoning, tool orchestration

* 10 Multi-turn logic, adaptive branching, planning across context

## Integration Feasibility (Optional)

## Score

Criteria

* 5 Persistent state tracking, PII access

* 7 Multi-system orchestration or compliance constraints

* 10 Mission-critical integration, regulated environments

## Design Principles for Grounded Seed Examples

Each seed example should:

* Clearly state why agentic AI is needed or not

* Identify where static logic breaks down

* Include autonomy and decision complexity scoring

* Reference specific indicators: e.g., multi-turn refinement, tool orchestration, escalation logic

## Examples Mapped to These Guidelines

## Agentic AI Example – Customer Support Routing

* Reasoning over sentiment and CRM data

* Confidence-based escalation

* Memory across steps

## Agentic AI Example – Voice-Based Shopping

* Conversational planning

* Contextual refinement across steps

* Tool chaining (catalog API → cart API → payment)

## Hybrid Example – Billing Reconciliation

* Static matching engine + agentic explanation/correction

* Agent handles post-exception workflow

A practical guide to building agents

## Traditional Automation Example – PDF Invoice Generation

* Fully structured input

* No ambiguity or exception handling

* Ideal for deterministic scripting

## Agent Architecture

Agents are built using three components:

Model

– LLM for decision-making and reasoning

Tools

– External functions or APIs (e.g. CRM, scheduler, RAG)

Instructions – Guardrails, escalation logic, goal definition

Agent execution is governed by looped evaluation of context until a goal or stop condition is met.

## Integration Readiness

You may not need a full agent for tasks like:

* Formatting structured reports

•

Sending templated emails

* Simple API requests without interpretation

Use traditional automation when:

* Input is predictable

* Output is fixed

* No reasoning or fallback logic is required

## Use Traditional Automation When...

Use a rule-based or deterministic workflow (i.e., traditional automation) when the task meets most or all of the following criteria:

* - Input is structured and consistent (e.g., form fields, database records)

* - The path from input to output is linear or well-defined

* - No contextual interpretation or memory is required

* - There are no ambiguous decisions, retries, or fallbacks

* - Business rules rarely change and are easy to update manually

* - Tools or APIs (if used) are always called in a fixed order

- No decisions depend on real-time analysis, user sentiment, or confidence scores

- There is no need for language understanding, planning, or tool orchestration

## Recognizing Hybrid Patterns

Some workflows blend both traditional automation and agentic reasoning. These hybrid patterns occur when:

- A deterministic backend (e.g., rule-based engine or ETL pipeline) is augmented by an

agent that handles exceptions, explanations, or adaptive recovery.

- An agent triages incoming tasks and routes them to automated processes when

appropriate.

- A workflow uses automation for data processing and agentic logic for natural language interaction, escalation, or goal planning.

## Hybrid Decision Flow Table

| | Workflow Type || Indicators | |
| --- | --- |
| |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------| ||
| | Traditional Only || Fixed rules, no ambiguity, static paths | |
| | Agentic Only || Unstructured input, tool selection, reasoning over data | |
| | Hybrid || Static rules with agentic fallback, post-hoc reasoning, or triaging | |

## Output Label Structure for Training

To support consistent dataset labeling and model evaluation, each example should follow this structure:

* - `classification`: One of `agentic`, `automation`, or `hybrid`

* - `autonomy_score` (1–10): Numeric estimate of the system’s independence

* - `complexity_score` (1–10): Numeric estimate of the workflow’s branching logic, ambiguity, and reasoning load

* - `rationale`: Explanation based on traits like ambiguity, decision-making, tool use,

fallback handling, and planning

This output schema can be used both for human labeling and as a model response template for fine-tuning or evaluation.
