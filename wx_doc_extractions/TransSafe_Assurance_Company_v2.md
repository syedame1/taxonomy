## 2. Definitions

* Policyholder: The individual(s) listed on the Declarations Page as the insured.

* Deductible: The amount the Policyholder is required to pay out-of pocket before insurance benefits apply.

* Premium: The amount the Policyholder pays to maintain coverage, based on the selected rate plan and coverage limits.

* Coverage Endorsements: Additional options that adjust the coverage benefits, deductibles, or claim process parameters based on accident severity.
